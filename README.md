# Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualizer! This interactive tool allows you to visualize the step-by-step execution of various algorithms, making it easier to understand and learn.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: See algorithms in action with real-time visual representations.
- **Wide Range of Algorithms**: Includes sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and more.
- **Code Integration**: View and understand the code alongside the visualization.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Input your own data to see how algorithms perform under different conditions.
- **Educational Insights**: Detailed explanations of algorithms, including complexity analysis.
